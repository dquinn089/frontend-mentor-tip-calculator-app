## Overview

This is my submission for my eleventh Frontend Mentor project, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is a tip calculator app that allows users to input their bill amount, select a tip percentage or input a custom tip, and calculate the total amount as well as the amount per person. The app also includes validation for the number of people and custom tip options.

## My process

I started by structuring the HTML to define the main elements of the app, like the bill input, tip options, and result section. I then moved to JavaScript to handle the logic for calculating the tip and total amounts, including validation for the number of people and custom tips. The final part was styling the app to ensure it was responsive and visually consistent with the design specifications.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of form validation and user input handling in JavaScript. I also became more comfortable with building responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox. Additionally, I gained more insight into managing state in a small app by toggling active selections in the tip options.

### Continued development

I plan to improve my approach to form validation, especially when handling edge cases. I would also like to dive deeper into using JavaScript libraries for UI components to minimize repetitive coding for things like form inputs. I'm also focusing on improving my workflow to reduce back-and-forth between styling and functionality implementation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Great for understanding CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Helped me troubleshoot some issues with form validation.
